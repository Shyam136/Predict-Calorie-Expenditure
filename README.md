## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

This project was developed for the Kaggle Playground Series S5E5 Competition: **Predict Calorie Expenditure**. The goal was to estimate daily calorie expenditure based on features like heart rate, duration, and age.

This document summarizes my iterative approach, comparing two versions of the notebook and outlining model choices, validation techniques, and key results.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Kaggle Playground Series S5E5
- **Training Data**: Features such as HR_Duration, Duration, Temp_HR, Age, BMI, and the target variable `Calories`.
- **Testing Data**: Same features as the training data (excluding `Calories`).

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Notebook Versions: Summary and Differences

### üîπ Version 1: `predict-calorie-expenditure.ipynb`

- **Goal**: Develop baseline models using LightGBM and RidgeCV with a basic ensemble strategy.
- **Key Components**:
  - LightGBM with Bayesian Optimization.
  - RidgeCV linear model.
  - Weighted blending to combine predictions.

### üîπ Version 2: `predict-calorie-expenditure-v2.ipynb`

- **Goal**: Enhance modeling pipeline with more advanced techniques.
- **Key Components**:
  - Added LassoCV and ElasticNetCV for regularization.
  - Stacking Regressor to combine multiple models.
  - Retraining loop using Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning.
  - SHAP analysis for feature importance visualization.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Development and Rationale

- **LightGBM**: Chosen for its speed and performance on tabular data, with hyperparameters optimized via Bayesian Optimization.
  
- **RidgeCV, LassoCV, ElasticNetCV**: Provided linear baseline models with regularization, helping control overfitting.

- **Ensemble Techniques**:
  - Weighted blending combined different models for improved generalization.
  - Stacking Regressor leveraged multiple models‚Äô strengths by feeding them into a meta-regressor.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Validation Techniques

- **5-Fold Cross-Validation**: Ensured consistency across different data subsets.
- **Validation Metric**: Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE) consistent with competition evaluation.
- **Early Stopping**: Stopped training when performance plateaued.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Results and Performance

- **Best Public Leaderboard Score**: 0.05906
- **Private Leaderboard Score**: 0.05906 (final official ranking).
- Notebook validation scores closely matched leaderboard scores, reinforcing model stability.
